# SDTProject
project for Sprint 4 Software Development Tool

In this project, I took used car for sale dataset and created scatterplots and histograms to analyze and visualize the price distribution of vehicles of 
different types (i.e. SUV, truck) and vehicle of different model years. First, I had to review the data to make sure there were no duplicate rows and removed 
all missing values using pandas. Other libraries that were used are plotly express and mathplotlib, and streamlit is used to create an app that allows for 
users to input different vehicle model year and different vehicle types and histograms of the cost distribution for the selected vehicle year/type will be 
displayed for easy understanding of the range.
